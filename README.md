City Hospital – Data Preprocessing &amp; Exploratory Analysis project 

Project Description:
In today’s healthcare scene, patient
care and satisfaction are vital. Hospitals
must continuously seek ways to
differentiate themselves and understand
patient needs. Therefore, City Hospital, which provides services
across multiple departments, aims to leverage the data collected
by its information systems to enhance patient care and
operational efficiency.
The data available represents patient interactions and
treatments across various departments, reflecting the hospital’s
overall performance and patient demographics. To harness this
data effectively, City Hospital’s management has assembled a
team of data scientists to analyze and segment patient
information. Within this team, there is a dedicated subgroup
focused on data preprocessing (DP Team).
The DP Team’s role is to prepare the data for advanced
analytical methods and provide initial insights into hospital
operations and patient care patterns. This is crucial as the hospital
currently lacks comprehensive information on its activities and
patient behaviors.
City Hospital requires an exploratory analysis to address
fundamental operational questions and an analytic-based table
(ABT) for descriptive analysis and patient segmentation.
Essentially, you are the Data Preprocessing (DP) Team inside City
Hospital’s Data Science group. Your job is not to build predictive
models yet, your tasks are utilizing data from the hospital’s
information systems to create an ABT, which will then be handed
over to the next team for further analysis and implementation.
